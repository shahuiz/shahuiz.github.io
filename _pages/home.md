I am currently a PhD candidate in Cryptology at Nanyang Technological University (NTU). I am supervised by Prof. [Jian Guo](https://guo.crypto.sg) and funded by [Nanyang President's Graduate Scholarship](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/nie/admissions/graduate-education-admissions/scholarships-awards/nanyang-president's-graduate-scholarship-(npgs)). I received my BSc in Math from NTU in 2023 with [KK Pua Gold Medal](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/spms/about-us/awards/student-awards#kkpgm) and [Ng Kong Beng Best Project Prize](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/spms/about-us/awards/student-awards#ngkongbeng).

Last time I checked, my [Erd≈ës number](https://www.csauthors.net/distance/tianyu-zhang-004/paul-erdos) was 4.

***Research Areas***: *quantum cryptanalysis, automated cryptanalysis, hash functions*
